# Ansible docsite personas

Personas represent various humans who are all on different automation journeys with Ansible. These docsite personas help put users in context to identify their technical content needs at each stage of their respective journeys.

We use personas to ensure Ansible community users can find help when and where they need it. If the right support is there, users are much more likely to succeed with their goals. This leads to higher levels of adoption and a more vibrant, stronger community.
